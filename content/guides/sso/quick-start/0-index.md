# Okta SSO Integration Quick Start

[Okta][okta] is a popular access management and identity platform used by
companies to provide a unified method for managing and authenticating into
multiple applications with a single set of credentials and a single secure
dashboard. 

When connected to a custom Box application, the [Okta APIs][okta-dev] may be
used to provide a single login mechanism to identify users within the Box
application, allowing you to have a unified experience between your unified
identity system (Okta) and the Box APIs.
