# Run Sample

With all the components of the sample in place, it's time to run our program to
see if everything is working correctly.

From the terminal / command prompt in the local application directory, type
`node server.js` and click enter. The server will start up and output
`Server started: Listening on port 3000`.

From your browser, go to `http://localhost:3000/`. Since this is the first time
we'll be testing out the user sign in flow, you'll see the Okta login.

Sign in with the credentials for the Okta user you created in the last section
of [step 2](g://sso/quick-start/setup-okta/).

Once signed in, you will see a message stating
`New app user {{USERNAME}} created` output to the console / terminal. 

When attempting to log in with this user in subsequent attempts, you
will now see the user record for that newly created Box app user being output
to the console / terminal.

From Eclipse (or your preferred editor) click to run the application. You will
see console output stating that the Spring boot application is now running on
port 8080.

From your browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/`. Since this is the first time
we'll be testing out the user sign in flow, you'll see the Okta login.

From the terminal / command prompt in the local application directory, type
`env FLASK_APP=server.py flask run` and click enter. The server will start up
and output `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

From your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Since this is the first time
we'll be testing out the user sign in flow, you'll see the Okta login.

## Next Steps

We recommend the following resource for anyone who wants to learn more about
more advanced capabilities that may be attached into the user creation and
access process.

 folder architecture setup.
* [User deprovisioning](g://users/deprovision/) best practices cleaning up
 inactive users and transferring user content to another account.
* [Uploading content](g://uploads/) into Box, including running preflight
 checks and large file (chunked) uploading.
