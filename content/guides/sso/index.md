# Identity Management (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) services are used as part of company Identity and Access
Management (IAM) solutions. When deployed, these services grant users the
ability to securely authenticate with multiple applications by logging in once,
with only one set of credentials (username and password). Box is one of the
applications that may be connected to the SSO service of a company.

Popular SSO services include `Okta`, `Auth0`, `Microsoft Azure AD`, `OneLogin`,
`G Suite`, and `Ping Identity`, but there are many others that may be deployed.

When integrating SSO services into a Box application programmatically, we are
referring to the following flow:

1. A user accesses your application in a logged out state.
2. The user is redirected to the SSO service to log in (typically via `OAuth 2`
 and `OpenID Connect` flows).
3. After login, the user is redirected back to your web application along with
 their SSO identity credentials.
4. If there is an associated Box user already (have already logged in
 previously), the SSO identity credentials are used to make calls on behalf of
 that user in Box.
5. If there is not an associated Box user already (first time logging in), a
 new Box user account is created, based on the SSO identity credentials. The
 unique user ID from the SSO service is then bound to the new Box user record
 to created the association between the two account for future login attempts.

<Message notice>
  If you wish to connect your SSO service to the Box website instead of a Box
  application, Box provides a number of [integration options][sso-support] for
  supporting SSO integrations of the [Box web application](https://www.box.com)
  via SAML 2.0.
